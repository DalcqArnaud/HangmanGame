## The mission

You have to make a website version of the {hangman}[hangman] word game. To do so
try to think the *structure*, the *backend* (functionality) and the *frontend*
(design) of your project before you start coding.

At the very least your version of the *hangman* should:

* propose an hidden word 
* allow the selection of letters
* verify if a selected letter belongs to the word
* count the number of failure (lives)
* check if it's a _game over_
* check if the word as been found

Optionally it can:

* keep in memory all guessed letters
* only let the player guess a letter once

NOTE: The instructions below are meant to guide you not impose a way of doing
things, what matters is the end result.

.Instructions
* create the repository
* think the project through
* write the backend (make it functional)
* write the frontend (make it pretty)
* implement both parts into a web page
